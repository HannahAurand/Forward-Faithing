# faithforward

A project inspired by the need for better communication between churches. There is a problem in the religion with churches
being segregated by race, creed, and age. This app is a prototype for a place that every church could post events to try to get
members from different churches to attend to create solidarity instead of segregation. 


Created using Express, Mongoose, Handlebars, Node. Basic CRUD functionality. 

At a later date, when I understand more, I would like to add user authentication, comment features and messaging ability for event coordination between churches.
