## Project 2 Idea

1. The problem: A fragmented church in DC. Segregated by denominatin, tradition, and race.
2. The solution: Solidarity, undoing the social boundaries that separate us and fragment our mission to bring good to the world through spiritual unity.
3. The means: technology that lists inter-denominational events all in one place 
4. Why: So that people aren't only looking at their own church's website for things to do or places to go to meet with other members of the faith to do good. Putting everything in one place will help people of this younger generation find everything in one spot, and easily add their own events once they've made a profile. 

## MVP

1. Add events to the site so that other people know where, when and what they are.
2. Update (edit) events with wrong details
3. Show events on a front page for all to see

## Bronze 

1. Delete events that have passed
2. Create a user profile that allows people to add and edit their own events

## Silver

1. Comment feature for events, for users to post their plans
2. Calendar to show when all the events are listed
3. Create an "attending" toggle for users to click to keep track of the number of people attending the event, with age-range.

## Gold

1. Map for showing where each event is. 

## User Stories

As a user, I would like to add events my church is hosting so that people from other denominations may see and attend.

As a user, I would like a profile to store my events.

As a user, I would like to be able to edit my events.

As a user, I would like to be able to see all the events from other churches available on a given day or week. 

As a user, I would like to be able to comment on events and let others know what I'll be bringing to coordinate.

I would like to privately message admin members to let them know what I'll need at the event if I have special needs like a wheelchair, sign-language interpreter, language interpreter, etc. 

As a church admin, I would like to know when other church events are so that we don't undermine another faith group by hosting a similar service on the same night, and we can instead tell our members to attend the other church's service to show support and solidarity. 

As a church admin, I would like to be able to see the demographic of the attendees so that I can better prepare for the crowd/provide snacks/drinks/etc.

As an admin, I would like to be able to message attendees to see if they have special needs and do my best to accommodate them.
